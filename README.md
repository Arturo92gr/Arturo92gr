## Hi, I'm Arturo ðŸ‘‹

I have decided to take a professional turn, get away from my path in fine arts and animation, to dedicate myself professionally to something that I have always liked, technology and software development.  
I am currently studying Web Application Development, training to give the best of myself in this sector.
